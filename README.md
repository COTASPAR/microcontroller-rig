# VSCode Microcontroller Flashing Rig

Flash your microcontroller remotely through a Raspberry Pi using the **unofficial** balena vscode extension I made here: [insert link]. This way, you can simply deploy this repository to your Raspberry Pi using the button below then hook up your microcontroller to it, and you'll be able to flash the microcontroller from within the VSCode IDE. Meaning, you can compile the code locally on your desktop/laptop and send the binary to the Raspberry Pi which will then automatically flash the microcontroller with your binary. 

## Features Roadmap
- Remote flashing [✓]
- Remote debugging [✘]
- Automatic testing with github actions [✘]
